            <h2>Matthew 5:14-16</h2>
            <p>
                14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. 
            </p>
            <p>
                15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
            </p>
            <p>
                16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

            <h2>1 Nefi 3:7</h2>
            <p>
                7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
